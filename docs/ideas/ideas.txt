marco polo existing trade mods
==============================
- if trade is positive and at a specific percent between open and TP, simply close it.  Set this percentage rather high (like .97 or so).
  this will prevent trades that "almost" hit TP and then proceed to crash down and hit SL.
- if NAV is up x % from the balance, close ALL TRADES

===========================
if trade is in positive territory at x (configurable per pair) percent between open and TP, move SL to break even

if trade is in positive territory at y (configurable per pair) percent between open and TP, move SL to z (configurable per pair) percent.
	- this results in getting some profit guarantee out of the trade

calcaulate price range (high and low) of x number of candles
for each candle, calculate the position of the close relative to the top of the range.
mark each candle with a number 0-9 meaning .0 to .9.  Store this sequence of numbers to the database.
go out y candles and calculate the new position.  Record this on the db as well.
Use these signatures to attempt new trades as the opportunities come up in the price action.
If signature is not found, calculate new signature and write it to the database.
